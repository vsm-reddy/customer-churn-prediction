Customer Churn Prediction

Problem Statement

In today's competitive business world, customer retention plays a crucial role in ensuring long-term success. The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are at risk of churning (discontinuing their service). Churn can significantly impact revenue and market presence, making it essential for businesses to take proactive measures.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to develop an accurate model that analyzes historical usage patterns, demographic information, and subscription details to predict churn probability. The insights from this model will enable businesses to implement personalized customer retention strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing churn rates.

Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of customer-related information that helps in predicting churn. Below are the key attributes:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

Name: Customer's name

Age: Customer's age

Gender: Male/Female

Location: Customer's geographic location (Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, New York)

Subscription_Length_Months: Duration of the customerâ€™s subscription

Monthly_Bill: Monthly billing amount

Total_Usage_GB: Total data usage in gigabytes

Churn: Binary variable indicating churn status (1 = Churned, 0 = Not Churned)

Outcome & Business Impact

The primary goal of this project is to create a model capable of accurately predicting customer churn. The predictions will enable businesses to:

Identify high-risk customers and take preventive measures.

Implement personalized retention campaigns.

Optimize resource allocation to focus on valuable customers.

Improve overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.

By leveraging this churn prediction model, companies can significantly reduce churn rates, ensuring long-term business growth and profitability.
